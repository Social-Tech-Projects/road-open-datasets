1. Introduction
===============

ROAD Scan JSON is an enriched format for encoding a variety of sensor data about
road infrastructure and geographic data structures.
ROAD Scan JSON object contains also geoJSON objects that represent a geometry,
a feature, or a collection of features.

GeoJSON objects supports the following geometry types: Point, LineString,
Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon, and GeometryCollection.
Features in GeoJSON contain a geometry object and additional properties, and a
feature collection represents a list of features.

A complete GeoJSON data structure is always an object (in JSON terms). In
GeoJSON, an object consists of a collection of name/value pairs -- also called
members. For each member, the name is always a string. Member values are either
a string, number, object, array or one of the literals: "true", "false", and
"null". An array consists of elements where each element is a value as
described above. 


:Dataset: Roadscan

accelX(float): Accelerometer data (m/s^2) measured on x axis

accelZ(float): Accelerometer data (m/s^2) measured on z axis
address(object): The mailing address. Model: https://schema.org/address
category(string): The category of the POI (Point of interest)
dataProvider(string): A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.
dateCreated(string): Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.
dateModified(string): Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.
description(string): A description of this item
gX(float): Angular velocity data (degrees per second) measured on x axis
gY(float): Angular velocity data (degrees per second) measured on y axis
