Social Tech Projects is a tech start-up that has created a digital solution called the ROAD System (https://roadsystem.io/). This innovative platform offers domain knowledge and expertise in the field of road optimization and maintenance. By leveraging space data from urban infrastructure, the ROAD System provides municipalities and road maintenance companies with valuable insights that can inform data-driven decisions about how to effectively plan and manage their roads.

By using IoT devices to perform road scans, authorities, institutions, and car manufacturers can access real-time data about road infrastructure and the surrounding urban environment and by utilizing data-driven insights such as predictive maintenance information and benchmarking key performance indicators can prioritize interventions and sustainable policies.

Our system offers a unique solution to road assessment with its innovative combination of space data collection, optimization (ML/AI), and automation. This streamlined approach enables faster, more efficient assessments while providing valuable insights into road infrastructure and the urban environment. With real-time data available through a user-friendly web-based management system, our system empowers authorities, institutions, and companies to make informed decisions.
